Accounting Module
=================

The accounting module targets for a complete financial and accounting 
package. But the first target is to offer the input of posting records 
for further processing by a tax counsellor. Only the two most basic
reports will be available within the system:

* subsidiary trial balance
* business assessment

And there will be an export function for the DATEV system. The DATEV
system is used by most of German tax counsellors so this interface seems
like the most practical interface for data export from our system.

But the system has never the less some unique selling points for use by
companies:

# generic chart of accounts
# multiple prima nota per journal
# multiple journal per period
# support for non-calendar fiscal year and changes of them

And since most companies use the service of a tax counsellor in any case
the advanced reporting can be done by the counsellor systems. The two
basic reports should be sufficient for most companies during the months.
