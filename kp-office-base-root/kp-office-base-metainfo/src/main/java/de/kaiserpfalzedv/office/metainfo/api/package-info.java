/**
 * A licensing and meta information service for the software. The base is the nice package of
 * {@link https://github.com/verhas/License3j License3j - Free Licence Management Library} which implements a
 * cryptographic license based on GPG.
 * <p>
 * The KP Office is open source. So licensing normally would not be needed. But there are some parts which will cost
 * us <em>real money</em> to implement (like the German tax export module, where we will have to pay the tax office for
 * certificating our exports). And we need to get that money back. So these modules won't be licensed without fee. Don't
 * know when we will implement them. But I liked the idea of incorporating this license manager, so I did it.
 * <p>
 * Just annotate the licenced classes or method calls with {@link de.kaiserpfalzedv.office.metainfo.api.Licensed} and the
 * {@link de.kaiserpfalzedv.office.metainfo.impl.LicenseInterceptor CDI interceptor} will check the calls if a matching
 * feature exists within the {@link de.kaiserpfalzedv.office.metainfo.api.OfficeLicense license}.
 * <p>
 * The implementation will use the {@link de.kaiserpfalzedv.office.metainfo.impl.OfficeLicenseImpl} to work with (which
 * in turn uses the {@link com.verhas.licensor.License} as backend for most functionality). But the user of the library
 * will only get access to the {@link de.kaiserpfalzedv.office.metainfo.api.OfficeLicenseTO transfer object} which does
 * not contain any hint on License3j.
 * <p>
 * Future plans include a licensing server for end user licenses and a licensing server for floating licenses.
